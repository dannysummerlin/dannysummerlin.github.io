<p>Then Almitra spoke again and said, And what of <strong><em>Marriage</em></strong> master?</p>

<p>And he answered saying:</p>

<p>You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.</p>

<p>You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.</p>

<p>Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.</p>

<p>But let there be spaces in your togetherness,</p>

<p>And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.</p>

<p>Love one another, but make not a bond of love:</p>

<p>Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.</p>

<p>Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup.</p>

<p>Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,</p>

<p>Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.</p>

<p>Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping.</p>

<p>For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.</p>

<p>And stand together yet not too near together:</p>

<p>For the pillars of the temple stand apart,</p>

<p>And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow.</p>
