# Hello, I'm Danny

## I like to build things that make the world a better place

With over twenty years in education and technical spaces, I am passionate about learning and using technology to support impactful outcomes. Education is the most powerful tool to improve lives and end cycles of poverty, and using technology in a human-centered way my role is to amplify the hard work of educators and learners with the right tools and strategies for long term and big picture success.
